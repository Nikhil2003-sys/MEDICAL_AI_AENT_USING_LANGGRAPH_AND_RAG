# MEDICAL_AI_AENT_USING_LANGGRAPH_AND_RAG
This project is a simple AI agent built using LangGraph that answers medical questions from a given PDF document. It uses the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach to search the PDF for relevant content and generate accurate answers. A short reflection step is also added so the agent can check whether its answer is relevant to the question.
